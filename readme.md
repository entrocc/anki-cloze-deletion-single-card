Anki: Cloze Deletion Single Card
----

A very simple Anki plugin that allows you to add as many cloze deletions to a card as you want, always showing it up in a single card. In other words, whenever you add a cloze deletion in a card, you always will get a tag using "c1". For example: 

    In {{c1:1957}} the {{c1::Soviet Union}} launched the world's first artificial satellite, the {{c1::Sputnik 1}}.

**Simple (and recommended) installation:**

1. Open Anki, go to "Tools -> Add-ons -> Browse & Install" and paste this code: "1392166854".
2. Well done.

**Manual Installation:**

1. Download the file "Cloze_Deletion_Single_Card.py"
2. Put the file into your "addons" folder (inside your Anki folder).
3. If you're running Anki, restart it and try to add some cloze deletions to your cards.
